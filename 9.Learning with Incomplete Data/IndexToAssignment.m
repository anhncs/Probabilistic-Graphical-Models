% IndexToAssignment Convert index to variable assignment.
%
%   A = IndexToAssignment(I, D) converts an index, I, into the .val vector
%   into an assignment over variables with cardinality D. If I is a vector, 
%   then the function produces a matrix of assignments, one assignment 
%   per row.

function A = IndexToAssignment(I, D)
